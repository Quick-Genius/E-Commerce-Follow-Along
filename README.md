# Milestone 7: User Login Endpoint 🌟

### Overview
In this milestone, we created a backend endpoint for user login functionality. The focus was on validating user credentials and securely verifying the encrypted passwords stored in the database.

### Key Achievements 🎯
- **Validated User Credentials**: Implemented functionality to accept and process user login requests.
- **Encrypted Password Verification**: Used bcrypt to securely compare hashed passwords stored in the database with the user’s input.
- **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for scenarios where users are not found or the password does not match.

### Why Password Encryption Matters
- **Protect User Data**: Ensures that passwords remain secure even if the database is compromised.
- **Privacy**: Prevents plain-text storage of sensitive information.
- **Compliance**: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
- **Prevents Password Theft**: Hashing makes it nearly impossible for attackers to reverse-engineer passwords.

---

## How Login Authentication Works 🔑
1. **User Enters Credentials**:
   - The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.

2. **Fetch User Data from Database**:
   - The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username.
   - If the user is not found, an error is returned: `"User does not exist."`

3. **Compare Encrypted Passwords**:
   - Hash the user's input password using the same algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
   - Compare the resulting hash with the stored hashed password.
   - Authenticate the user if the hashes match; otherwise, return an error.

---

## Steps Implemented in Milestone 7 📝
1. **Login Endpoint**:
   - Created a backend route to handle user login requests.
   - Accepted `email/username` and `password` as inputs.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - Used bcrypt to securely hash and compare passwords.
   - Returned appropriate success or failure responses.

3. **Database Interaction**:
   - Retrieved user data from the database based on the input credentials.
   - Verified if the user exists and validated their credentials.
